# Animal Health Ontology (AHO)

AHO aims to support data interoperability in animal health - it focuses on modeling the structure of the animal population and the health data recorded about animals, such as clincial observations, laboratory tests, animal movement registries, etc, 

“An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them”. [(Noy & Mcguiness, 2001)](http://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology\_development/ontology101.pdf)

Several terminology catalogues already exist in health and epidemiology. Ontologies can incorporate these existing resources and re-use all their knowledge. But we move beyond the listing of concepts and include also “relationships” between concepts (semantics), creating a knowledge model for health surveillance. A machine-interpretable version of the domain knowledge offers several advantages, in particular: 
•	Use of automated reasoners to make inferences and detect errors in the data.
•	Flexibility to accommodate to knowledge growth and updates. 
•	Reuse. Ontologies are meant to model specific pieces of knowledge, in a way that allows linking to complementary pieces. As epidemiology is highly multi-disciplinary, the use of ontologies allows us to piece together expertise from many different domains. 
•	Interoperability. Terminologies allow humans to understand each other and agree on what things mean. Ontologies allow software to talk to each other.

## Project management and structure
This project is managed by the [Swedish National Veterinary Institute](http://www.sva.se). 
This project started as the Animal Health Surveillance Ontology, funded by the Swedish Innovation Agency - [Vinnova](http://www.vinnova.se/en/). It has evolved into an ontological framework composed of AHO, as well as a surveillance focused ontology which also incorporates other health domains (visit [HSO](https://github.com/SVA-SE/HSO))
